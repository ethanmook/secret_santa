First line used as subject line
Subsequent lines used as body. Performs string formatting to insert *recipient*
data from the players csv file. For example:

{name} will be replaced with the name of the recipient (as found in the
recipient's row of the players csv file). The name in the braces must match the
name of one of the columns in the csv file.

For the example_players.csv file {email} will also work and will be replaced
with the recipient's email.

The formatting will also replace any instance of double pipe "||" in the csv
file with a line break.
