# Lines beginning with '#' are ignored
# Rules are each a single line of the form:

column_name:giver_val (gets|nogets) other_column:recipient_val

# meaning anyone with value giver_val in column_name is either guaranteed to get
# or bared from getting someone with value recipient_val in other_column


# Examples:

# Bob will be assigned to buy for Sally

name:Bob gets name:Sally

# No one in group 2 will be assigned to buy for Bob

group:2 nogets name:Bob


# If you want to match on a value in a column that has spaces, it must be
# surrounded by quotation marks. For example:

name:"Bob Smith" nogets name:"Alice Jones"

# Warning: At the moment, rules are enforced by simply generating a derangement
# randomly until it satisfies all the rules. If you add many rules that are
# restrictive, it will take significantly longer to generate (or may run
# infinitely).
